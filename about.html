            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Who is Edgar Viveros?<br> I'm many things: an entrepreneur, a runner, a plane fanatic, and culinary lover. I was born and raised in Georgia. 
                Being the oldest of six, I quickly learned to be responsible and self-realiant. I graduated from Norcross High School in 2014 and went straight into the construction industry. Building a residential contracting company from the ground up over the last decade has been fulfilling, but it has not felt like my true passion. I am now back in school and furthering my education for a whole new career in the Tech field! </p> 
            <p>My professional experiences are mostly comprised of construction management skills. 
                Vendor, employee, and client coordination for projects were key aspects of my day-to-day. 
                I have worked with municipal governments such as Gwinnett, commercial clients such as Burger King, and a wide arrary of resedential customers in bringing buildings and other structures up from initial drawings to final product. 
                I plan to carry what I learned over the last 9 years into Cyber Security. As of now, I have taken classes learning python, javascript, R, and SQL.</p> 
            <p>My goal is to, first, absorb all the knowledge I can about best practices and expectations of IT professionals.
                 I am currently applying for internships and mentorships in the tech field so I can now start applying what I have learned in classes in real-world scenerios. 
                 The best way to learn is through action, and I always try to live up to those words. My overall dream is to serve our country in either the FAA or FBI; where I will be able to use by security knowledge to protect citizen and national assets.</p>
